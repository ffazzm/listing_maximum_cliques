# listing_maximum_cliques
A Branch-and-Bound algorithm for list all maximum cliques in a graph. I am utilizing k-clique covering node set from “Decomposing clique search problems into smaller instances based on node and edge colorings” paper by Sándor Szabó, Bogdan Zavalnij as branching strategy. The program is written in Python and uses NetworkX library.

This program created as my bachelor thesis implementation.
